# blackHoleBasketball
This is Black Hole Basketball.
A mobile game where you place black holes to manipulate the trajectory of a basketball.
The goal is to get the basketball into tho hoop.
With each level the game gets a bit harder. After the game introduces some ostacles like wood planks and other black holes the solutions are anything but trivial.


Notes:

I use a grab-pass shader to create the distortion around the black holes. This looks stylish and makes the interactions with the black holes more intuitive.

I made sure that the physics in this game are deterministic. The game is all about fine adjustments. If there was randomness, you would have to get lucky to get the ball into the hoop.
To achieve this you have to reload the scene after every throw.
